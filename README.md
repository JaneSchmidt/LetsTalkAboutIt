# Let's Talk About It

This is the beggining of a blog web application that will be used to talk about anything, and everything!

To develop this web app I will be using MAMP as the local server. This project is mainly focused on backend processes so the front end will be very simple, using only HTML and CSS. The backend will be developed using PHP and MySQL.
